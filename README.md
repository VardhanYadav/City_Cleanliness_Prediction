This study presents the development of a machine learning (ML) model aimed at predicting the cleanliness scores of Indian cities for the upcoming year, utilizing a dataset sourced from Kaggle. As urban cleanliness significantly impacts public health and environmental sustainability, accurate forecasting of cleanliness scores can aid policymakers and city planners in implementing effective sanitation strategies.
The dataset encompasses various factors influencing cleanliness, including waste management efficiency, pollution levels, and citizen feedback. The model employs several ML algorithm i.e. Gradient Boosting to analyze historical data and predict future cleanliness scores. A rigorous evaluation process is conducted to compare the performance of this algorithm using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
Preliminary results indicate that the Gradient Boosting model demonstrates superior predictive capabilities, achieving an accuracy of over 90%. This research not only enhances understanding of the determinants of urban cleanliness in India but also provides a valuable tool for proactive management of city sanitation efforts. By leveraging data-driven insights, this model aims to foster cleaner urban environments and improve the overall quality of life for residents.
